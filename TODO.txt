- UI
- When entity attacks it should move forward and back to its original position
- Create animation when entity moves, no teleporting
- Bug that after a round you can control the enemy's solider
- Randomize where the bought entity spawns
- Maybe wall entities that enemy entities cannot pass (they have to destroy/kill it first) to protect the base
