- Maybe wall entities that enemy entities cannot pass (they have to destroy / kill it first) to protect the base
- When a warrior attacks another entity that entity should get damage after the warrior is on it's cell and when that entity dies the warrior shouldn't move back
- Add button to worker to repair base (Done, but probably buggy)
- Add posibility to create hotkeys on 1-9 for selecting cells

LATER:
- Add option that a bought entity doesn't get selected automaticly
- Add option menu especially for sound volume
- Add REAL multiplayer
